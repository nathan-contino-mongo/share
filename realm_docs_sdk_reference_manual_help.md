# Realm Docs Team SDK Reference Manual (API Docs) Collaboration

# Motivation

- API documentation could use some love/attention
- Docs folks can add an extra set of eyes to make sure that descriptions are current, language is clear, etc.
- Wordings, sentence structure, descriptions

# Product Description

## Proposed Solution

- docs writers help with API docs, updating them when they notice gaps or inconsistencies
- tickets to improve API docs independently
- docs writers as a highly suggested LGTM on SDK work (anywhere that touches code or logic that impacts API docs)
    - help with wording suggestions
    - help by asking questions, suggesting additional information to add

## Goals

- build comradery and relationships between docs and the realm SDK teams
- improve quality of API docs
- improve wording of API docs, make more consistent with docs docs

## Non-Goals

- docs team will not block SDK work -- we're just helping out, trying to make the API docs even better

## Use Cases

- all realm-<language> sdk repos

# Success Metrics

- API docs correctness and clarity is improved
- side-effect: more collaboration, comradery between docs and the realm-sdk teams
